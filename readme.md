## About

FreezeTag is a minecraft plugin which I made last year 2024. It is based on the real life tag game. Where there will be two teams the freezer aka. tagger and the players if the freezer manage to touch/freeze a player that player will be frozen. If all player become frozen then the tagger wins otherwise the players win.

*This plugin is buggy and in snapshot state*
